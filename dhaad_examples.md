## 1. Hello World (Classical Pillar)

**Prints a canonical greeting to stdout using fDhaad and uDhaad pillars.**

```dhaad
fDhaad print("Hello, Dhaad World!")
    = uDhaad transmit(
        target: "stdout",
        data: "Hello, Dhaad World!",
        reality_anchor: "classical"
    );
    transmission_clean = check: entropy == 0.0
=> print("Hello, Dhaad World!") = bytes_written: 20
````

---

## 2. Pillar-Based Variable Declaration

**Declares and sets a variable in pure pillar syntax.**

```dhaad
iDhaad let answer = 42
    = vDhaad set("answer", 42)
    => answer: 42
```

---

## 3. Strict Canonical Function (No Dots)

**Defines and calls a dot-free function, canonical Dhaad style.**

```dhaad
fDhaad greet(name)
    = uDhaad transmit(
        target: "stdout",
        data: "Greetings, " + name + "!",
        reality_anchor: "self"
    );
    transmission_clean = check: entropy == 0.0
=> greet("Dhaad") = bytes_written: 18
```

---

## 4. Self-Healing and Auto-Repair

**Demonstrates Dhaad’s auto-repair and self-healing via pillar logic.**

```dhaad
fDhaad self_heal("system_core")
    = uDhaad repair("system_core"),
      cDhaad log("Healing event logged at T+", now())
    => system_core.status = "repaired", entropy: 0.01
```

---

## 5. Pillar-Driven Conditional Logic

**Conditional execution based on user input, showing on\_pass/on\_fail handling.**

```dhaad
lDhaad condition("user_input")
    = check: input == "cosmic",
      on_pass: uDhaad transmit(target: "stdout", data: "Cosmic user detected"),
      on_fail: uDhaad transmit(target: "stdout", data: "Standard user detected")
```

---

## 6. Quantum Reality Integration

**Quantum bridge between two qubits using Dhaad's uDhaad and mDhaad pillars.**

```dhaad
uDhaad entangle("qubit_a", "qubit_b")
    = mDhaad quantum_bridge(qubits: ["qubit_a", "qubit_b"])
    => entangled: true, entropy: 0.0
```

---

## 7. Mythic Story Pillar

**Narrative output with sDhaad and cDhaad for mythic storytelling and logging.**

```dhaad
sDhaad tell("Once upon a pillar, Dhaad unified all realities.")
    = cDhaad log("Mythic narrative invoked at T+", now())
    => narrative: "unified", reality: "mythic"
```

---

## 8. Interfacing with External Python Healing

**Connects to an external Python validator for syntax and healing.**

```dhaad
#~> python-connect: ./Dhaad_validator/syntax_pattern_check.py
fDhaad validate_external("file.dh")
    = uDhaad python_bridge(
        target: "./Dhaad_validator/syntax_pattern_check.py",
        args: ["file.dh"]
    );
    => validated: true
```

---

## 9. Strict Indentation, Space-Delimited Structure

**Shows Dhaad’s strict space-based structure and pillar-only lists.**

```dhaad
iDhaad list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    = fDhaad print("List values:", list)
    => uDhaad transmit(target: "stdout", data: list.toString())
```

---

## 10. Substrate Awareness & Auto-Heal

**Self-healing logic that adapts to substrate, checks entropy and repairs as needed.**

```dhaad
#~> substrates: ["self", "auto", "quantum"]
fDhaad heal_if_needed(module)
    = lDhaad condition("needs_healing") =
        check: module.entropy > 0.1,
        on_pass: uDhaad repair(module),
        on_fail: cDhaad log("No healing needed for", module)
    => result: "checked", healed: module.entropy <= 0.1
```
