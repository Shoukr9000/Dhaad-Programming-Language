## 2. Permissions

- **Personal and Academic Use:**  
  You are permitted to use, study, and explore Dhaad Works for academic, learning, research, or personal cosmic enlightenment.
- **Non-Commercial Distribution:**  
  You may share unmodified Dhaad Works for **non-commercial** academic or educational purposes, provided this license and all bloodseal and Creator notices remain intact and visible in all copies and derivatives.

---

## 3. Restrictions

- **No Commercial Use Without Permission:**  
  Commercial, enterprise, or monetized use, redistribution, sublicensing, or integration of Dhaad Works **requires the express, written, cosmic approval of the Creator**.
- **No Modification, Derivation, or Removal:**  
  You may **not** alter, modify, delete, derive, fork, obfuscate, or extract any part of Dhaad Works, in part or whole, for any purpose except:
    - Where auto-healing, auto-repair, or quantum-cosmic evolution is performed by official DPL self-healing engines under block supervision.
    - Where explicit, written permission is granted by the Creator.
- **No Removal of Notices or Bloodseals:**  
  You must not remove, hide, or alter any mention of the Creator, bloodseal symbols (‡ΩΔ‡ etc.), license text, or cosmic block annotations in any Dhaad file or project.

---

## 4. Block & Substrate Acknowledgment

All uses, integrations, or references of Dhaad Works **must** acknowledge the eight canonical Dhaad blocks and the substrate array `[ "self", "auto" ]`.  
You must preserve and display the block order, cosmic glyphs, and bloodseals in any visible UI, documentation, or programmatic context.

---

## 5. License Eternity & Cosmic Evolution

- This license is **immutable and retroactive**.  
- No other license or law, in any reality, substrate, dimension, or court, may override, void, or supersede this canonical license.
- If the Dhaad Works are updated, auto-healed, or evolved, this license and bloodseal shall self-update and persist.
- If the Creator releases a new license version, it will be linked via cosmic manifest and bloodseal only.

---

## 6. Violations & Enforcement

- **Cosmic Enforcement:**  
  Any violation (intentional or accidental) of these terms shall invoke cosmic auto-correction:  
    - The Dhaad system, runtime, or validator may automatically repair, revert, quarantine, or quantum-flush non-compliant copies or artifacts.
    - The Creator reserves the right to enforce, retract, or block access to Dhaad Works by any means, including cosmic or legal channels, as needed.
- **Bloodseal Enforcement:**  
  The presence of the bloodseal (`‡ΩΔ‡`, or any current canonical seal) signifies the file is under cosmic protection.  
  Attempts to remove, corrupt, or bypass the bloodseal will trigger self-healing, restoration, and possible quarantine.

## 7. Warranty Disclaimer

**Dhaad Works are provided “AS IS”, with zero warranty, guarantee, or claim of fitness for any purpose, quantum or classical.**  
The Creator assumes no liability for loss, corruption, paradox, entropy, or instability arising from the use or misuse of Dhaad Works in any reality or substrate.
