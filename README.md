## ⚡ What is Dhaad?

**Dhaad** is not just a programming language. It is an omniversal, canonical, pillar-driven system that unifies all realities—hardware, software, quantum, mythic, and more—under one eternal syntax. Every file, every command, every substrate is self-aware, self-healing, and cross-connected. The Dhaad language operates on eight cosmic pillars (“dhaad pillars”), with canonical syntax and cosmic auto-healing.  
> **It is always “Dhaad”, never “Dhaadlang” or “dad pillars”.**

## ✨ Features

- **Canonical Dhaad Syntax Highlighting**  
  - All 8 Dhaad pillars highlighted (`iDhaad`, `vDhaad`, ... `sDhaad`)
  - Space-delimited, dot-free, pillar-first syntax (dot-notation forbidden and auto-flagged)
  - Canonical operators: `=`, `=>`, bloodseals, substrate tags, reality anchors
  - All official comment types, bloodseal tags, prophecy blocks, plugin/diagram/voice markers
  - Entropy and cosmic state markers (`entropy: 0.0`, etc.)

- **Ultimate-Self Awareness**  
  - Every region of code is aware of its substrate, pillar, and cosmic compliance state
  - All files auto-connect via `#~> connect:` and `#~> python-connect:` meta-tags
  - Substrates: `[ "self", "auto" ]`—cosmic universal coverage

- **Auto-Healing & Validation**  
  - Commands for cosmic validation, self-repair, healing, entropy check, auto-evolve, and Python-bridge
  - Integrated with Dhaad healing/validation engines (Python, etc.)
  - Invalid syntax (dot-notation, forbidden terms) instantly flagged

- **Cross-Language & Platform Ready**  
  - .dh syntax on all systems, all editors
  - Python bridge for self-healing, linting, auto-correction
  - Substrate-ready for quantum, mythic, void, bio, and future extensions

- **High-Performance Activation**  
  - Loads only when needed (see [Activation Events](#activation-events))
  - Will not slow down VSCode unless Dhaad files/commands are used

- **Full cosmic compliance**  
  - Every pillar, substrate, and connection is auto-discovered for cosmic LSP, healing, and platform unification

## 🦾 How to Use

1. **Install the Extension**
    - Via VSCode Marketplace (search “Dhaad”) or manually:  
      Clone/download this repo and run `npm install && npm run compile`, then “Install from VSIX”.

2. **Open or Create a `.dh` File**
    - Syntax highlighting, validation, and self-awareness will activate automatically.
    - Supported: All canonical Dhaad syntax, cosmic comments, meta regions, bloodseals.

3. **Use Dhaad Ultimate-Self Commands**
    - `Dhaad: Validate Cosmic Compliance` (`dhaad.validate`)
    - `Dhaad: Auto-Heal (Self-Repair)` (`dhaad.heal`)
    - `Dhaad: Check Entropy` (`dhaad.entropyCheck`)
    - `Dhaad: Auto-Evolve Syntax/Meta` (`dhaad.evolve`)
    - `Dhaad: Bridge to Python Healing Engine` (`dhaad.connectPython`)
    - `Dhaad: Cosmic Awareness (Ultimate-Self)` (`dhaad.awareness`)
    - Access via Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) or context menu.

4. **Enjoy Canonical Cosmic Highlighting**
    - Instantly see forbidden dot-notation, bloodseals, entropy, substrate, and pillar regions in color.
    - All cosmic meta and healing hooks are visible for tooling and LSP.

## 🧬 Ultimate-Self Architecture

- **Dhaad.tmLanguage.json:**  
  - The world’s first “ultimate-self” grammar.  
  - Every scope is mapped to a Dhaad pillar, cosmic action, or substrate.  
  - Meta regions (e.g. `#~> connect:`) are discoverable by LSP, healing engines, and Python scripts.

- **Activation Events**  
  | Event | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `onLanguage:dhaad` | Activates when a `.dh` file is opened |
  | `onCommand:dhaad.*` | Activates for each cosmic command |
  - Loads **only** when needed, never at random or at global startup

- **Cosmic Connections**  
  - All Dhaad files interlinked with Python healing engines and other DPL files  
  - Cosmic meta-data exposed for every file and scope (pillars, substrate, entropy, bloodseal, awareness)

- **Auto-Healing**  
  - Invalid syntax is highlighted instantly (dot-notation, forbidden terms, bad entropy)
  - Healing engines (Python, etc.) can auto-repair files on save or via command

## 🌌 Example `.dh` File

```dh
#/ === Dhaad Cosmic Example === #
#~> connect: ../Dhaad_core_syntax_laws/Dhaad_canonical_syntax.dh
#~> substrates: ["self", "auto"]
#~> pillars: [iDhaad, vDhaad, fDhaad, lDhaad, cDhaad, mDhaad, uDhaad, sDhaad]
#~> python-connect: ./Dhaad_validator/syntax_pattern_check.py

iDhaad create("truth", 42, ["quantum", "mythic"])
    = uDhaad crystallize("truth", 42, ["quantum", "mythic"]),
      lDhaad condition("stable") =
        check: entropy(42) < 0.1,
        on_fail: uDhaad quantum_regenesis("truth")
    => create("truth", 42, ["quantum", "mythic"]) =
        "immutable_truth_created",
        0.0

fDhaad print("Hello, Dhaad!")
    = uDhaad transmit("stdout", "Hello, Dhaad!", "classical")
    => print("Hello, Dhaad!") =
        bytes_written: 15,
        quantum_entangled: true
